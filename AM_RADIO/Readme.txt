This text file describes the basic setup details to use the AM Radio transmitter. It is very simple:
Note: the code and setup was done with the ATmega168.
All you need to do is to connect a 3 foot long 22-guage wire to PD5 and flash in the code to use it.
I will not include any schematics here because I am assuming that you know how to make basic power connetions with the AVR.
Then following the power delivery connections to the AVR, you can then connect an antenna to pin PD5 as described above.
After this is done, tune your radio to AM 1Mhz to listen to the tunes being played.
